When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

When the the code is ready for public view it is best to keep it local.  Additionally,
if your computer is damaged in some way.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

There may be changes that are not ready to be absorbed by your code.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
