Reflection 1
First reflection on the course.  So far, we learned about Diff (FC in
windows) command to compare two files. By using the diff command I was
able to see the lines that changed between the two files.  It is
important to keep the length of the lines between 80 to 120 characters.

Reflection 2
It will help track down the defects that may be introduced during one
of the builds.  Furthermore, it makes reverting back to an earlier
working stage much easier.

Reflection 3
Pros: Manually choosing when to commit makes the commit more meaningful
Cons; Manually choosing when to comint introduces the risk of not commiting on time.

Reflection 4
Why does Git allows multiple file commits?

Reflection 5
Git log can be used to see the history of commits with usefull messages.
Git diff can be used to compare to commits

Reflection 6
Git, version control in general, would make a programmer more confident because a prior version without defect could be loaded giving the developer a way to find defects. 

Reflection 7
I want to try using git to manage all of my projects
